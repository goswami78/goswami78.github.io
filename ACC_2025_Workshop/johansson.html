<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The efficiency of control systems that operate over shared communication networks closely
relates to the networkâ€™s ability to deliver services and allocate resources. Cellular network technologies,
such as 5G and 6G, offer customized services for diverse network needs. Given the strict real-time control
requirements and safety specifications of many emerging applications, there is a demand for adaptable,
control-aware network services. This insight points towards a combined design of both physical and network
layers with the control laws, to guarantee that the required quality-of-service matches the intended quality-
of-control. However, achieving an optimal combined design is tricky due to the interdependencies between
layers, where the design necessarily hinges also on the amount of shared information in the system. In
this talk, we will discuss how to formulate and solve such co-design problems. We will illustrate the
results through examples from vehicular and traffic control, showing how data-driven learning and control
can be integrated in a systematic way for future intelligent transport systems based on connected and
automated vehicles. The presented results have been developed together with students, postdocs and
industrial collaborators.
