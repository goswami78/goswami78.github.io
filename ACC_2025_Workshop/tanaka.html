<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this talk, we will discuss a policy gradient method (PGM) over the so-called input-output history (IOH) representation and its application to the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) dynamic output feedback control synthesis. First, we establish the equivalence between the dynamic output feedback and the static partial state feedback under a new system representation characterized by the finite-length IOH. Using this equivalence, we search for the optimal dynamic output feedback controller via the search for the optimal partial state feedback gain. Due to the sparsity constraint on the feedback gain matrix, the latter problem belongs to the class of static output feedback design problems, which by itself is a well-recognized challenging problem. Nevertheless, by exploring a low-dimensional representation of the closed-loop system, we show that the cost function is smooth and exhibits a gradient dominance property under a few mild conditions, ensuring linear convergence of the PGM to the global optimum. This is a joint work with Dr. Tomonori Sadamoto.
