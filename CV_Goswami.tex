\section{Research Interests}
%My thesis is primarily based on estimation and control of nonlinear systems using mixture models and Koopman operator theoretic approach. I have also worked on target detection and tracking using aerial vehicles and lift control of an airfoil. My interest lies in the \emph{Koopman spectral approach to nonlinear dynamical systems and control, stochastic estimation and control of complex nonlinear systems, and implementation of such}.

%My thesis is primarily based on estimation and control of nonlinear systems using mixture models and Koopman operator theoretic approach. I have also worked on target detection and tracking using aerial vehicles and lift control of an airfoil. My interest lies in the \emph{estimation and control of nonlinear and complex systems and its applications}.
I am broadly interested in designing safety-critical controller for robotic automation from the noisy sensor data and resource constraints. I want to apply tools from dynamical systems, Koopman operator theory, machine learning, and temporal logic to develop a framework of data-driven model identification, estimation, and control with a guarantee of performance to achieve ``assured autonomy''. Some of my past and current research interests are
\begin{itemize}
\item learning dynamical systems with unknown parameters,
\item nonlinear estimation and stochastic control,
\item data-driven reduced-order modeling and control of complex systems,
\item transfer operator based approach to dynamical systems,
\item autonomous tracking and search using drones.
\end{itemize}
