<h2>Keynote Speaker: Bethany Hannah</h2>
<h3>Igniting Innovation: Transforming Wildland Fire Management for a Resilient Future</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The increasing intensity and complexity of wildfires demand bold, innovative approaches to
management and resilience. This keynote will explore how reimagining current strategies and
embracing collaborative approaches can drive transformative change in the wildland fire space. It
will highlight the critical questions and considerations necessary to ensure that solutions are not
only technologically advanced but also practically viable for those working on the ground. By
bridging the gap between innovation and real-world application, this presentation will
demonstrate how attendees can contribute their voices and expertise to global wildland fire
management efforts—leveraging cutting-edge ideas to build a more resilient and adaptive future.
Attendees will be challenged to think beyond traditional approaches, sparking a collective effort
to reimagine how we can balance wildfire’s natural role in our ecosystems with the urgent need
to protect vulnerable communities and landscapes in the face of a changing climate.
