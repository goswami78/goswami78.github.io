=== Safe Robot Autonomy in Unknown and Dynamic Environments 

=== Abstract

Recent advancements in computer vision, AI, and control theory have significantly enhanced the capabilities of autonomous robots in tasks such as package delivery, underground mapping, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite these improvements, integrating AI into autonomous systems introduces new challenges in safety and reliability. This talk addresses these challenges by focusing on the safe integration of AI components for perception and decision-making in autonomous systems. I will present a novel mission planning algorithm designed for teams of mobile robots equipped with AI-enabled perception systems, operating in unknown and dynamic environments. This algorithm utilizes statistical methods to quantify perceptual uncertainty, which is then incorporated into the mission planning process. It enables robots to perform high-level tasks (e.g., surveillance, delivery) while adhering to user-specified probabilistic task and safety requirements, and actively mitigating environmental uncertainties arising from imperfect perception. Applications to wildland fire management will also be discussed. I will also discuss extensions of this algorithm to handle dynamically changing missions and unexpected robot failures that may occur in adversarial environments. Case studies involving both aerial and ground robots will be shared to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

=== Detection and Suppression of an Incipient Wildfire using a UAV 

=== Abstract

This talk describes the development of an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system designed to detect, localize, and suppress incipient wildfires. The system is designed with a commercial UAV in mind, but with an emphasis on the scalability and portability of its components. The key contributions of this research are the design and testing of a multi-spectral fire detection algorithm utilized in broad area surveys, a fire localization routine that utilizes the fire detection data to design an optimized flight path for revisiting potential fire sites, and the integration of a third-party drop system with the commercial UAV in order to deliver suppressant payloads to fire sites. These critical components are combined together to form an end-to-end fire process chain, which fuses autonomous and manual UAV functions into a procedure where one UAV can conduct fire detection, localization, and suppression activities utilizing two different mission profiles. Extensive testing of the fire process chain in totality and across its individual components is conducted, the results are thoroughly analyzed, and suggestions for future wildfire management UAV systems are provided.

=== Aerial Robot Autonomy for Metric-Semantic Terrain Mapping

=== Abstract

An important aspect of wildland fire management is pre- and post-fire monitoring of the environment. Autonomous aerial robots offer significant potential for persistent monitoring of outdoor terrain to aid wildfire prediction and impact analysis. This talk will present (1) mapping techniques to estimate terrain geometry and semantics in real time using aerial images, (2) planning techniques to generate robot flight trajectories for persistent monitoring, and (3) control techniques to achieve safe autonomous trajectory tracking despite uncertainty and disturbances.
