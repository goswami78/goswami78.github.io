<h3>Safe Robot Autonomy in Unknown and Dynamic Environments </h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Recent advancements in computer vision, AI, and control theory have significantly enhanced the capabilities of autonomous robots in tasks such as package delivery, underground mapping, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite these improvements, integrating AI into autonomous systems introduces new challenges in safety and reliability. This talk addresses these challenges by focusing on the safe integration of AI components for perception and decision-making in autonomous systems. I will present a novel mission planning algorithm designed for teams of mobile robots equipped with AI-enabled perception systems, operating in unknown and dynamic environments. This algorithm utilizes statistical methods to quantify perceptual uncertainty, which is then incorporated into the mission planning process. It enables robots to perform high-level tasks (e.g., surveillance, delivery) while adhering to user-specified probabilistic task and safety requirements, and actively mitigating environmental uncertainties arising from imperfect perception. Applications to wildland fire management will also be discussed. I will also discuss extensions of this algorithm to handle dynamically changing missions and unexpected robot failures that may occur in adversarial environments. Case studies involving both aerial and ground robots will be shared to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<h2>Derek A. Paley</h2>
<h3>Applied Autonomy for Robotic Perception and Situational Awareness </h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This talk will describe ongoing research in applied aerial and ground autonomy for multi-robot systems equipped with advanced perception. The research is being conducted by faculty, staff, and students in the Maryland Robotics Center in collaboration with the UMD UAS Research and Operation Center and the UMD School of Medicine. First, I will present applied aerial autonomy and air-ground coordination efforts for extended range operations under the ArtIAMAS (AI and Autonomy for Multi-Agent Systems) cooperative agreement with the Army Research Lab. Second, I will present advancements in non-contact robotic assessment of personnel in mass casualty incidents developed for the DARPA Triage Challenge. Lastly, I will describe a UAS solution developed for the XPrize Wildfire competition, which seeks to use drones to detect and suppress emergent wildfires.

<h2>Nikolay A. Atanasov</h2>
<h3>Aerial Robot Autonomy for Metric-Semantic Terrain Mapping</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>An important aspect of wildland fire management is pre- and post-fire monitoring of the environment. Autonomous aerial robots offer significant potential for persistent monitoring of outdoor terrain to aid wildfire prediction and impact analysis. This talk will present (1) mapping techniques to estimate terrain geometry and semantics in real time using aerial images, (2) planning techniques to generate robot flight trajectories for persistent monitoring, and (3) control techniques to achieve safe autonomous trajectory tracking despite uncertainty and disturbances.
