<h3>Firefighter Drones- Low-altitude Fleet of Drones in Forest Fire Management </h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Commercial and civilian applications of drones are becoming increasingly popular, with current applications in aerial photography, shipping and delivery, precision agriculture, remote sensing, and many more yet to come. UAVs have been increasingly utilized in several search and rescue and disaster monitoring operations to collect data/imagery. The current UAV-based operations often involve single or multiple remotely controlled UAVs led by commanders in a ground station or pilots in manned aircraft that can still endanger the life of first responders. The full potential capabilities of UAV technology cannot be utilized unless the drones are used in an autonomous mode. Therefore, the future of drone technology is expected to be dominated by smart, small and low-cost autonomous drones that cooperate and coordinate to perform compound missions such as wildfire management with no or minimal human interventions. In this talk, we discuss some of our recent work related to task allocation, communication, and onboard wildfire detection in a network of autonomous UAVs as well as the datasets of aerial images collected by our team during prescribed fires.

<h3>Wildfire Tracking with UAV Swarms</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Being equipped with cameras and sensors, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be instrumental for wildfire prediction, tracking, and monitoring, provided that uninterrupted connectivity can be guaranteed even if access points (APs) are damaged by the fire. Cell-free UAV networks, where connectivity to multiple APs enhances the reliability, provide a suitable context. This work proposes a multi-UAV trajectory optimization framework to track wildfires while maintaining cell-free connectivity.

<h3>Optimal Scheduling of Human Attention in Multi-human and Multi-Robot Collaboration Systems </h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In contemporary robotic systems, effective collaboration between humans and robots is pivotal, especially when multiple autonomous agents operate concurrently. This talk presents an innovative approach to optimizing human-robot interaction, particularly focusing on the critical management of human attention. We explore a scenario where human operators must address simultaneous collaboration requests from multiple robots, a common challenge in advanced robotics operations. To address this, we propose a novel integer optimization framework aimed at maximizing operational efficiency across all robots while adhering to the constraints of human cognitive capabilities and introduce a Contention-resolving Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to allocate humans’ attentions to assistant robots’ tasks. This talk will detail the methodologies used, the theoretical underpinnings of our approach, and the practical implications of our findings on the design of future human-centric robot collaboration systems.
