<h2>Technical Keynote Speaker: Sebastian Scherer</h2>
<h3>Resilient Autonomy in Smoke and Other Environmental Degradation</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Robots show great promise if they can get out of the lab into the field and go beyond a single-operator per robot paradigm. However, the unstructured nature of the real-world requires nuanced decision making of the robot. In this talk I will outline some of our approaches, progress, and results on multi-modal sensing, providing nuanced perception inputs, as well as navigation in difficult terrain, and extensions to multi-robot teams, and future directions of our research.
