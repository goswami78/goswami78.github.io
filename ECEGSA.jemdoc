== ECE Graduate Student Association

 - I volunteered as a board-member of the [https://blog.umd.edu/ecegsa/ ECE Graduate Student Association] from Fall 2016. I served as the president for the same in 2018-19 academic year. I have organized several departmental events including academic career panel three years (2016-18) in a row. During my tenure as the ECEGSA president, I managed the core responsibilities of ECEGSA as well as communicated with the Graduate Student Government about the petition for the Collective Bargaining right and fellowship hike. 

 - As a long-standing member of the ECEGSA, I have also interacted with the departmental faculties, arranged ECEGSA academic seminars throughout the year, and communicated with the faculty-guests for different departmental events.
