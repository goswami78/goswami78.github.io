== About me
Thank you for visiting my site. I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering ([https://mae.osu.edu/ MAE]) at The Ohio State University. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Maryland ([https://ece.umd.edu/ UMD]), USA, under the supervision of [https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/58/Derek-A-Paley/ Prof. Derek A. Paley] in 2020. Prior to that, I did my undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/ Jadavpur University], India in 2015. I spent two years in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering ([https://mae.princeton.edu/ MAE]) at Princeton University as a postdoc. You can find my dissertation [mainthesis.pdf here] along with the [DissertationSlides.pptx slides].

== SOAR Lab
We work on exciting research problems at the interscetion of dynamical systems, machine learning, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Please visit our [SOAR_Lab/index.html lab page] for more information.
